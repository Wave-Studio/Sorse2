## Contributing

See [the nonextistent contributing file](Committing.md)! We love more people to help with this project, and if you have any questions feel free to ask on [our discord](https://discord.gg/jV5Jvt7z).

## Bugs

If you believe you have found a bug then do the following:

1. Create a **clean** install of Sorse.
2. Attempt to reproduce the bug. Confirm its _actually_ a bug and not a user error.
3. If you can reproduce it, then file a bug report [here](https://github.com/wave-studio/JSBoard/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBug%5D+%3CInsert+your+title+here%3E). In some cases you may need to keep the repo and publish it to Github so we can see the issue for ourselves.

## Feature Requests

Create a feature request [here](https://github.com/wave-studio/JSBoard/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BRequest%5D)

## Install

Installing is pretty simple, all you need to do is download the ZIP and open it in VSCode, make sure you have Node.js and Yarn, then run `yarn`, `yarn build`, and `yarn start` in that order. We'll have more information when we release our first MVP.

## Background

JSBoard wasn't always this clean and polished. Its first version looked a little something like this:

We also had this as well:

Yea, those were some dark days...

Next up, we have the "jsboard-frontend" written in plain html with ejs (which is not a framework, by the way, it's sort of like a budget components implementation. I'm sad to say I (quick007) was impressed when I first saw this...). It also has express and tailwind, which I used their [components page](https://tailwindcomponents.com) and some "css action" to create this absolute masterpiece:

Today of course we have the look of today's JSBoard. Honestly, there's a lot of new design stuff I'd (quick007) love to throw at it someday, but for now, you're going to have to like the playful stacked boxes theme I've created.

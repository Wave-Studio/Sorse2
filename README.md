## Bugs

If you believe you have found a bug then do the following:

1. Create a **clean** install of Sorse.
2. Attempt to reproduce the bug. Confirm its _actually_ a bug and not a user
   error.
3. If you can reproduce it, then file a bug report
   [here](https://github.com/wave-studio/JSBoard/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBug%5D+%3CInsert+your+title+here%3E).
   In some cases you may need to keep the repo and publish it to Github so we
   can see the issue for ourselves.

## Install

Installing is pretty simple, all you need to do is download the ZIP and open it
in VSCode, make sure you have Node.js and Yarn, then run `yarn`, `yarn build`,
and `yarn start` in that order. We'll have more information when we release our
first MVP.
